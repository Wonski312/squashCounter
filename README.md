### Squash Points Counter

My latest project is directly connected with my new hobby. Squash game (absolutly lovely game) very dinamic play and compiting with a friend is somthing I was looking for.

App features counting points for each player and sets wins.

Future updates will cover:

- [ ] Adding score to database 
- [x] Adding player name before start of counting points 
- [ ] Authentication and remembering previous players names.

It's a REACT app:
Main reason for building this app is to practice the React Redux and it's toolkit which is implemented now to easly move state around the components.

Css but it's on the other plan therefore I want to focus most on the react logic and it's deeper understanding so hopfully nobody will judge this app on it's cover :)
