### Squash Points Counter

My latest project is directly connected with my new hobby. Squash game (absolutly lovely game) very dinamic play and compiting with a friend is somthing I was looking for.

App features counting points for each player and sets wins.

Future updates will cover:

-[ ]Adding score to database -[ ]Adding player name before start of counting points -[ ]Authentication and remembering previous players names.
